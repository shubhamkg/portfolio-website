    <!-- Example 1: Float Left -->
    <div>
      <h2>Float Left</h2>
      <img
        src="images/free-nature-images.jpg"
        alt="Float Left"
        class="float-left"
      />
      <p>
        This image is floated to the left. The text flows around the right side
        of the image. We didn’t need clearfix here because the text naturally
        keeps the parent stretched. Floats are great for small media inside
        articles — think of text wrapping around an image in a news story.

        class="float-right"
      />
      <p>
        This image is floated to the right. The text flows around the left side
        of the image. Again, no clearfix is needed because the text pushes the
        container's height. This image is floated to the right. The text flows

        alt="Float None"

      />
      <p>
        This image has float: none, so it stays in the normal flow of the
        document. The text does not wrap around it — instead, it appears below
        or above like a normal block element. This image has float: none, so it

        Here, we floated one image left and another right. The text fills the
        space in between. The parent container wraps. Here, we floated one image
